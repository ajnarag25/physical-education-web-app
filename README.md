<h4> The study, Innovation of Physical Education System in Technological University of the Philippines Cavite Campus, is focused on the development and implementation of the web-based application system for the PE department, which displays all the functions using a friendly graphical user interface, that would enable the users to access all the features, such as ordering uniforms, borrowing sports equipment, and reservation of facilities in the campus. This web-based application system is developed using PHP and MySQL for databases. </h4> <br>
<h4>This proposed research study also includes the innovation of the project which is the Sports Equipment Borrowing Machine. </h4> <br>
<h4>This prototype requires otp from the web-based application of the PE system, which will enable the users to borrow sports equipment, specifically volleyball and basketball balls. In addition to this prototype, it also has coin acceptors that allow users to buy ping pong balls one at a time. The system and the prototype were tested according to its functionality, accuracy and reliability which satisfy the objective of at least 85% rating.  </h4> <br>
<h4>The TUP Evaluation Instrument for Developed Prototype was adopted to evaluated the performance of the Sports Equipment Borrowing Machine and the performance of the PE system is also evaluated using the ISO 25010 evaluation instrument which both have also satisfies its objective of at least 4.5 mean per each category and was able to achieve a descriptive rating of Very Acceptable. </h4> <br>
